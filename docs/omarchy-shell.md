# omarchy-shell

A single long-running [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org/) instance
that hosts the Omarchy desktop. The bar, panels, overlays, menus, and
services all run inside as plugins. Hyprland autostart launches the
shell via `omarchy-launch-shell`; restart it with `omarchy-restart-shell`.
IPC is the canonical way for CLIs to talk to a running shell —
`omarchy-shell` forwards a call and fails when the shell is not running
(`-q` makes it quiet best-effort; `OMARCHY_SHELL_IPC_TIMEOUT` bounds the
wait).

## Plugin manifest

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "my.org.cool-clock",
  "name": "Cool clock",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "You",
  "description": "A clock that does cool things",
  "kinds": ["bar-widget"],
  "entryPoints": { "barWidget": "Widget.qml" }
}
```

`kinds` (a manifest may declare more than one):

| Kind         | What it is                                  |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `bar-widget` | Component the active bar drops into a section |
| `bar`        | Full bar option that can replace `omarchy.bar` |
| `panel`      | Floating window (e.g. OSD)                     |
| `overlay`    | Fullscreen overlay (e.g. background picker)    |
| `menu`       | Summoned menu surface                          |
| `service`    | Headless singleton, no UI                      |

Only one full bar option is active at a time. The built-in `omarchy.bar` is
used when `bar.id` is omitted or when a selected third-party bar cannot load.
Panels, overlays, and menus are loaded when summoned. Plugins can set the top-level manifest key `keepLoaded: true` to survive between summons, and to keep a service mounted across plugin hot-reload (so `omarchy.lock` is not destroyed while Hyprland still holds the session lock). First-party services are loaded at startup.

Entry points are QML `Item`s. Panel, overlay, and menu entry points expose `open(payloadJson)` and `close()` for summon/hide; on load the host injects `omarchyPath`, `shell`, `manifest`, and the registries (`pluginRegistry` / `barWidgetRegistry`) as properties. Built-in plugins receive the trusted host objects. Third-party plugins receive capability-scoped facades instead: ordinary plugins may look up and control only their own service and lifecycle, built-in clones retain narrow source-specific configuration and UI compatibility, menu plugins receive an application-library facade, and plugins can read detached scalar bar state. A full-bar plugin additionally receives detached bar configuration and widget-catalog snapshots, narrow proxies for the non-authentication services used by built-in bar widgets, and lifecycle control over configured non-authentication UI plugins. Authentication capabilities are stamped from trusted first-party manifests, authentication services are kept out of the host's public service map and QML object tree, and third-party registry/configuration snapshots can be changed only locally without mutating host state. The facades are API boundaries, not same-process QML sandboxes: a visual widget shares the host bar's scene and can walk its parent hierarchy to ordinary host objects. Sensitive state must not rely on the facade alone for isolation.

A third-party replacement bar can render registered widget components, but widgets it hosts receive a service-less entry facade. Allowing the bar to manufacture an own-service facade for an arbitrary widget would also let it retrieve that plugin's live service object. Service-backed third-party widgets therefore retain their full integration only under the trusted built-in bar; a replacement bar may still provide their target-scoped lifecycle and settings operations.

Full schema: [`shell/services/PluginRegistry.qml`](../shell/services/PluginRegistry.qml).

## Installing a third-party plugin

A plugin is a **git repo** with a `manifest.json` at its root. Adding one
clones it straight into `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/<id>/`; updating is a
fast-forward pull:

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/acme/omarchy-weather.git
omarchy plugin update                # fetches, shows a diff, fast-forwards
omarchy plugin remove acme.weather
```

**Setup › Plugins** offers Enable, Disable, Add, Clone, and Remove. Enable and
Disable include built-ins as well as installed plugins. Clone is limited to
built-ins, while Remove is limited to installed plugins since a built-in has
no checkout to delete. Add, Clone, and Remove open a terminal so their warning,
editor, confirmation, and output stay visible.

Cloning `omarchy.clock`, for example, creates and switches to
`~/.config/omarchy/plugins/<username>.clock/` (e.g. `dhh.clock`), names it
`My Clock`, and preserves the built-in IPC identity so existing shortcuts keep
working. The username prefix keeps a shared clone from colliding with anyone
else's. Saving files in any installed plugin reloads its code automatically,
and removing an active clone switches back to its built-in source.

For a bar widget, on and off means its place in the bar. Everything else is
loaded by default when it is built in, so `shell.json` records only the
deviation: a third-party plugin you added under `plugins[]`, a built-in you
switched off under `disabledPlugins[]`. A full bar has no off state: enabling
one replaces the active bar, and it is therefore never offered under Disable.
Bar widgets may set `barWidget.defaultSection` to `left`, `center`, or `right`;
widgets that omit it default to `center`.

Plugins run as **unsandboxed code** inside `omarchy-shell`. Adding warns you before cloning, plugins land disabled so you can review the code before `omarchy plugin enable`, and updates show a diff before touching anything. Commands confirm in a terminal even when given arguments; without one they refuse rather than guess. Add `--yes` to skip every prompt (the path for scripts and agents). The scoped interfaces remove direct access to authentication services and avoid handing generic cross-plugin service factories to replacement bars, but visual plugins can still traverse ordinary objects in their shared QML scene. Plugin code also has the same user-level file and process access as the shell.

You can still install by hand: drop a plugin into
`~/.config/omarchy/plugins/<id>/`, run `omarchy-shell shell rescanPlugins`, then
`omarchy plugin enable <id>`. A bar widget starts in its declared default
section; enabling a full bar replaces the one in use. `omarchy bar` drives the
bar from the CLI — `use | reset | defaults | position | transparent | put |
move | set`, with placement flags such as `--section` and `--index`.
The lower-level IPC methods remain available through `omarchy-shell shell ...`.

## IPC

The shell exposes a `shell` target (the host also registers
`image-selector`) plus targets registered by individual plugins, named
for the plugin rather than for where it appears: `background`, `osd`,
`media`, `notifications`, and per-widget targets such as `omarchy.clock`
or `omarchy.power`. There is no `bar` target.

| `debugBarGeometry`                    | bar geometry dump for debugging |

`setPluginEnabled` takes a string; only literal `"true"` enables. Methods
answer on stdout with exit 0 — `ok` on success, `unknown` or an error
string on a miss.

## shell.json

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "idle": {
    "screensaver": 150,
    "lock": 300
  },
  "bar": {
    "id": "omarchy.bar",
    "position": "top",
    "transparent": false,
    "centerAnchor": "omarchy.clock",
    "layout": {
      "left":   [ { "id": "omarchy.menu" } ],
      "center": [ { "id": "omarchy.clock", "format": "HH:mm" } ],
      "right":  [ { "id": "omarchy.audio" } ]
    }
  },
  "plugins": [
    { "id": "community.weather-extra" }
  ]
}
```

Rules:

1. The active bar option is `bar.id`. Omit it or set it to `omarchy.bar` for
   the built-in bar; set it to a plugin whose manifest declares `kind: "bar"`
   to replace the full bar.
2. Every plugin instance is one entry — `bar.layout.<section>` for
   bar widgets, `plugins[]` for everything else.
3. Settings are inline on the entry. No `config:` sub-object, no
   merge layers.
4. Built-in bar widget ids are namespaced (`omarchy.clock`, `omarchy.audio`, …).
5. Third-party enabled ⇔ present; for full bar options that means `bar.id`.
   First-party non-bar plugins are enabled unless listed in `disabledPlugins[]`.
6. `barWidget.allowMultiple: true` in the manifest permits multiple instances.
7. `idle.screensaver` and `idle.lock` are seconds since user idle began.
8. `version: 1` is required.

`config/omarchy/shell.json` describes the fresh-install state. When no
user `shell.json` exists, defaults are used verbatim. Once the user
customizes, `shell.json` is canonical — there is no deep-merge.

`shell.json` is shell configuration; theme tokens live in `shell.toml`
(next section). Both are current — they answer different questions. A
machine-level `~/.config/omarchy/shell.toml` is watched live by the
shell and its keys win over the active theme's `shell.toml`, so
overrides like `omarchy display text size` survive theme switches.

## Theme tokens

See [`theming.md`](theming.md) for the full theme/template workflow,
including generated `*.tpl` files, gradient helpers, and shell border syntax.

Themes ship colors in `themes/<name>/colors.toml` and surface roles +
sizing in `themes/<name>/shell.toml`. Defaults are generated from
`default/themed/shell.toml.tpl`; a theme may also drop a hand-written
`shell.toml` next to its `colors.toml` to replace the generated file,
or override a single section with `shell.<section>.toml`, merged in by
`omarchy-theme-set-templates` (see [`theming.md`](theming.md)).

`colors.toml` uses `foreground` and `background` for the foundational
text/background palette, exposed to QML as `Color.foreground` and
`Color.background`.

The shell exposes these tokens to QML via three singletons in
`qs.Commons`:

- `Color` — palette (`foreground`, `background`, `accent`, `urgent`)
  and per-surface roles (`Color.bar.*`, `Color.popups.*`,
  `Color.tooltip.*`, `Color.notifications.*`, `Color.menu.*`,
  `Color.polkit.*`, `Color.lock.*`, `Color.imagePicker.*`). Clipboard
  and emojis share `Color.menu.*`; the `[launcher]` section is consumed
  by the launcher outside shell QML.
- `Style` — structural tokens (`cornerRadius`), shared interactive
  state tokens/helpers, spacing (`Style.spacing.*` / `Style.space(px)`),
  the type scale (`Style.font.*`), and bar dimensions
  (`Style.bar.sizeHorizontal` / `Style.bar.sizeVertical`).
- `Border` — border-spec helpers for QML surfaces. Use with
  `BorderSurface` from `qs.Ui` when a border should honor shell theme
  gradients or per-side widths. `Color.<section>.border` is only the
  flat-color fallback for code that cannot render a real border.

### Interactive states

`[controls]` standardizes reusable control chrome (buttons, dropdowns,
tab strips, etc.) around four states: `normal`, `hover-cursor`, `focus`,
and `selected`. State colors and border tokens accept palette roles
(`foreground`, `accent`, `urgent`, `background`) or hex strings; border
values may also be gradients. Fill alpha applies to the state color;
border alpha applies to the state's border token.

Surfaces like `[menu]`, `[launcher]`, and `[image-picker]` define
their own `selected-*` tokens and do **not** inherit from `[controls]`.
`[controls]` only governs the shared button/dropdown chrome.

| State | Color token | Fill alpha | Border token | Border width | Border alpha |
|-------|-------------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Normal idle chrome | `normal-color` | `normal-fill-alpha` | `normal-border` | `normal-border-width` | `normal-border-alpha` |
| Hover / keyboard cursor | `hover-cursor-color` | `hover-cursor-fill-alpha` | `hover-cursor-border` | `hover-cursor-border-width` | `hover-cursor-border-alpha` |
| Qt activeFocus | `focus-color` | `focus-fill-alpha` | `focus-border` | `focus-border-width` | `focus-border-alpha` |
| Persistent selected/current | `selected-color` | `selected-fill-alpha` | `selected-border` | `selected-border-width` | `selected-border-alpha` |

The template ships `focus-*` adjacent to `hover-cursor-*` with the same
values so mouse hover, keyboard cursor, and tab focus read identically.
Themes that want focus to stand out override the `focus-*` keys.

Border widths are the theme-level on/off switches for state borders; set
a width to `0` to keep the fill while removing that state border. The
default keeps selected borders off globally (`selected-border-width =
0`); explicitly bordered controls keep their normal border when selected.

```toml
[controls]
# Accent-tinted cursor/focus, foreground-tinted selected state.
hover-cursor-color = "accent"
focus-color        = "accent"
selected-color     = "foreground"
focus-border       = "rgba(33ccffee) rgba(00ff99ee) 45deg"

# Keep selected fills but remove selected-state borders.
selected-border-width = 0
```

Momentary fills use `pressed-fill-alpha` for button press feedback and
`selection-fill-alpha` for text selection. Themes may also provide
`pressed-color` or `selection-color`; they fall back to hover-cursor and
foreground respectively.

The section was previously named `[style]`. Hand-written theme
`shell.toml` files using the old name still apply — the parser accepts
both `[controls]` and `[style]`.

### Spacing

`[spacing] scale` multiplies the shell's shared margins, gaps, padding,
control sizes, and panel dimensions. The default is `1.0`; values above
`1.0` create more breathing room while values below `1.0` make controls
dense. By default `scale-with-font = true`, so increasing `[font]
base-size` also scales buttons, popup widths, row heights, and panel
padding proportionally.

```toml
[spacing]
scale = 1.15
scale-with-font = true  # grow controls and panels with [font] base-size
```

QML components should prefer semantic tokens where possible:

| Token | Default use |
|-------|-------------|
| `Style.spacing.controlPaddingX` / `controlPaddingY` | Button and tooltip padding |
| `Style.spacing.inputPaddingY` | Text-field vertical padding |
| `Style.spacing.controlHeight` / `popupRowHeight` | Dropdown and number-field row heights |
| `Style.spacing.dropdownWidth` / `searchableDropdownWidth` / `numberFieldWidth` | Default field widths |
| `Style.spacing.searchablePopupMinHeight` | Minimum searchable dropdown popup height |
| `Style.spacing.controlGap` | Gap between icon and label inside controls |
| `Style.spacing.labelGap` | Label-to-control and compact list gaps |
| `Style.spacing.rowGap` / `rowPaddingX` | Form rows and list row content |
| `Style.spacing.panelGap` / `panelPadding` | Panel section spacing and interior padding |
| `Style.spacing.popupPadding` | Popout interior padding |

Popout placement deliberately follows Hyprland's `general:gaps_out`
(`Style.gapsOut`) so panels align with tiled windows. Use a theme's
`hyprland.lua` to change that outer alignment; `[spacing]` controls the
interior breathing room.

For one-off proportional constants, use `Style.space(px)` to preserve the
old default at scale `1.0` and `base-size = 12` while still responding to
the theme scale and font scale. Use `Style.spaceReal(px)` only for
fractional geometry that should not be rounded, such as bar widget text
margins. Themes can override any semantic token directly in `[spacing]`,
e.g.:

```toml
[spacing]
scale = 1.0
panel-padding = 22
row-gap = 10
```

### Typography

`[font] base-size` is the rem root for the scale. Every
`Style.font.<token>` derives from it via a fixed multiplier, so
bumping `base-size` rescales the whole shell proportionally:

| Token                 | Multiplier | Default |
|-----------------------|------------|---------|
| `Style.font.caption`      | 0.833 | 10 |
| `Style.font.bodySmall`    | 0.917 | 11 |
| `Style.font.body`         | 1.0   | 12 |
| `Style.font.subtitle`     | 1.083 | 13 |
| `Style.font.title`        | 1.167 | 14 |
| `Style.font.heading`      | 1.333 | 16 |
| `Style.font.display`      | 2.0   | 24 |
| `Style.font.displayLarge` | 2.333 | 28 |
| `Style.font.iconSmall`    | bodySmall | 11 |
| `Style.font.icon`         | title     | 14 |
| `Style.font.iconLarge`    | 1.5       | 18 |

A theme can either scale everything by tweaking `base-size`:

```toml
[font]
base-size = 13   # roomier
```

…or pin individual tokens for stylistic emphasis without affecting
the rest of the scale:

```toml
[font]
base-size = 12
heading       = 20
display-large = 36
```

Recognized override keys: `base-size`, `caption`, `body-small`,
`body`, `subtitle`, `title`, `heading`, `display`, `display-large`,
`icon-small`, `icon`, `icon-large`.

`base-size` has no upper clamp; the shell only floors it at **1px** to
avoid nonsensical zero/negative sizes. Per-token overrides aren't clamped
either. The shell font family is the fontconfig `monospace` alias —
themes don't set it, the user does via `omarchy font set <name>`.

### Bar size

`[bar] size-horizontal` / `size-vertical` set the cross-axis dimension
of top/bottom and left/right bars respectively, measured at the default
12px font base. By default `scale-with-font = true`, so increasing
`[font] base-size` also increases the bar's cross-axis size:

```toml
[bar]
scale-with-font = true
size-horizontal = 26   # top/bottom bar height at base-size 12
size-vertical   = 28   # left/right bar width at base-size 12
```

Set `scale-with-font = false` to keep those bar sizes as fixed pixels.

## Bar icon geometry

Every icon in the bar is sized by the pixels it paints, not by its asset dimensions or font metrics. `shell/Ui/WidgetButton.qml`, the base of every bar button first- and third-party, treats a lone icon glyph, a glyph beside a label and any `iconComponent` the same way: the icon is rendered, `shell/Ui/InkMeasure.qml` has ImageMagick measure what it painted, and the icon is fitted from that measurement.

**How big** a mark comes out is read from the raw ink it paints, and fitted by the middle of its two dimensions rather than by whichever one reaches furthest. Fitting the long side alone halves a mark twice as wide as it is tall, so it renders at a fraction of the row's height; fitting the short side inflates that same mark into a slab that dominates everything beside it. `IconRules.meanFit()` takes the middle of the two, and a lone icon's canvas is cut wider than the block (`IconRules.canvasRoom`) so the long axis of a wide mark has somewhere to land.

That size is then nudged by how densely the mark is inked, because two icons the same size on a ruler are not the same size to a reader: a solid slab and a hairline arc filling one box are nowhere near the same weight. `IconRules.weightFit()` makes a dense mark a little smaller and a sparse one a little larger, bounded at both ends. Density is measured from the mark's shape, before any blur — measuring the blurred blob instead reports almost everything as solid, because the blob is deliberately larger and softer than the mark.

**Where it sits** is read from that blurred blob. The shape is smeared until it reads as one soft mass, levelled against its own peak and cut in half, and the mark is shifted so that mass sits centred along the bar. Levelling against its own peak rather than a fixed level is what lets the blur be strong: a thin glyph blurs to a faint mass, and a fixed cut erases such glyphs entirely. Across the bar the mark simply fills its block, and that is what lines a row up. Weight is only judged where the mark can still be moved — one already pressed against its canvas is pinned by its own size.

The block every icon is fitted to is measured from the font rather than set as a bare number: `[bar] icon-canvas` defaults to the height the icon block is drawn to at `[bar] icon-font`, so evening out an uneven row does not enlarge it — icons that already filled that box keep the size they have always had. A theme that pins `icon-canvas` gets exactly what it asks for.

A mark's shape is everything it paints above antialiasing fringe, taken **before** anything else is measured, so how brightly a part was painted never changes where the icon is measured to be: a logo drawn in two tones measures exactly like the same logo drawn in one. Brightness is then a rule of its own — one mark, one brightness, unless the mark really is drawn in two tones. `WidgetButton` weighs the faded parts of an icon against the whole of it: a second tone covering at least `IconRules.twoToneMinShare` of the mark is left as its author drew it, while anything less is one part faded by accident and goes back to full. Set `flattenIcon: false` to opt out.

Glyphs are re-rasterized at a fractional font size and re-measured until the rules hold — a native glyph can only be placed on whole device pixels, so the last fraction of a pixel is not correctable — while components are transformed and raster images go through `shell/Ui/AutoCropImage.qml`, which the tray uses. Text keeps its type metrics; a widget whose glyph is a text-sized marker in a run of text sets `normalizeIcon: false` (the workspace dot). Icon-only buttons take `[bar] icon-slot` so they space like built-in icons, and `BarIndicator` declares its smaller canvas.

The rules live in one place, `shell/Commons/IconRules.qml`. Within a tolerance of one logical pixel — or of one measured pixel, when the render is coarser than that — a mark must be `sized` (it came out the size the block asks for, measured the way it is fitted), `balanced` (its weight sits centred along the bar, where there is room to move it) and `contained` (no ink beyond its canvas, corners included). Every button verifies its final render against them and exposes `inkCompass` and `inkViolations`; `omarchy-dev-bar-icon-audit` collects these from the live bar through `omarchy-shell shell auditIcons`, prints each icon's margins alongside `BX`/`BY` and what it painted, and fails when any shown icon breaks a rule.

The open-panel mark under a module spans the module's icon canvas rather than the ink inside it. Every icon fills the same canvas but reaches it with a different silhouette, so a mark drawn to the ink comes out a different length under each one — wide under the wifi arc, narrow under the battery — and the row of them reads as ragged.

## Custom bar modules

If a full plugin is overkill, declare a one-off module inline in
`bar.layout.<section>`:

```json
{ "id": "vpn", "type": "command", "exec": "~/.config/omarchy/bar/scripts/vpn-status",
  "interval": 5, "tooltip": "VPN", "onClick": "nm-connection-editor" }
```

Output is plain text or Waybar-style JSON (`{ "text": ..., "tooltip": ..., "class": ... }`).

For a custom QML widget:

```json
{ "id": "gpu", "type": "qml" }
```

Then `~/.config/omarchy/bar/modules/gpu.qml` (or set `source` to point
elsewhere). The module is an `Item` and receives `bar`, `moduleName`,
`settings` properties. `bar` exposes `foreground` / `background` /
`urgent` / `fontFamily` / `position` / `vertical` / `barSize`, plus
`run(cmd)`, `showTooltip(t, s)` / `hideTooltip(t)`,
`requestPopout(o)` / `releasePopout(o)`. To shell-quote arguments for
`run`, use `Util.shellQuote(v)` from `qs.Commons`.
