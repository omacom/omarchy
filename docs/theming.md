# Omarchy theming

Omarchy themes live under `themes/<name>/` in the source tree (installed at
`/usr/share/omarchy/themes/<name>/`), with optional user themes under
`~/.config/omarchy/themes/<name>/`. A theme normally starts with a
`colors.toml`; Omarchy generates the active theme files from
`default/themed/*.tpl` when `omarchy-theme-set <name>` runs.

Beyond `colors.toml` and hand-written config overrides, a first-party theme can
ship `backgrounds/` (users overlay their own via
`~/.config/omarchy/backgrounds/<name>/`; the active image is the
`~/.local/state/omarchy/current/background` symlink), `preview.png` and
`preview-unlock.png` for the theme switcher, `icons.theme`, `keyboard.rgb`,
`unlock.png`, and a `light.mode` marker file.

A theme installed from a git repo is held to a much shorter list; see [What an installed theme may not ship](#what-an-installed-theme-may-not-ship).

## Backgrounds

A theme's images live in `themes/<name>/backgrounds/`, and users overlay extras in `~/.config/omarchy/backgrounds/<name>/`. The active background is always the `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/background` symlink, pointing at exactly one canonical image file; everything below happens at render time and never changes what that symlink points to.

### `backgrounds.toml`

A `backgrounds.toml` beside the images declares how they render. It is read from the same directory the canonical image lives in — the theme's `backgrounds/` or the user overlay directory — with no merging across the two:

```toml
[defaults]
fill = "crop"              # crop | fit | center | tile
backdrop = "solid"         # solid | edge | blur
fill_color = "background"  # colors.toml key OR "#rrggbb"
focal = "0.5 0.5"          # crop anchor, x y in 0..1
svg_layout = "fixed"       # fixed | responsive

["1-forest"]               # section = image stem; quotes optional for simple stems
fill = "fit"
backdrop = "blur"
focal = "0.65 0.4"
```

- `fill` picks the render mode: `crop` scales the image to cover the screen (the default, matching pre-metadata behavior), `fit` scales it to be fully visible, `center` places it unscaled, and `tile` repeats it.
- `backdrop` paints the space left by `fit`, `center`, or `tile`: `solid` uses `fill_color` and preserves the historical behavior, `edge` uses the dominant color sampled from the resolved image's perimeter with `fill_color` as its fallback, and `blur` places a quiet blurred cover copy behind the foreground. It has no visible effect with `crop` because the foreground already covers the screen.
- `fill_color` paints the area the image does not cover under `fit`, `center`, and `tile`, and backs SVG rasterization. A value starting with `#` passes through unchanged; any other value is resolved as a key from the active theme's `colors.toml`, falling back to `background`, then `#000000`.
- `focal` names the point of the image to keep in view when `crop` discards overflow: `"0.5 0.5"` crops symmetrically around the center, `"0.65 0.4"` keeps the point 65% across and 40% down.
- `svg_layout = "responsive"` gives an SVG the exact screen dimensions as its viewport, allowing percentage-based artwork to reflow instead of preserving one intrinsic canvas shape. It has no effect on raster images; the default `fixed` layout keeps the SVG's intrinsic aspect ratio.

Per-image sections override `[defaults]`. Section headers may be bare (`[1-forest]`) or quoted (`["1-forest"]`), and the stem is matched exactly against the canonical image's basename minus its last extension. Unknown keys are ignored, and invalid values fall back to the defaults (`crop`, `solid`, the theme background color, `0.5 0.5`). Without a `backgrounds.toml` at all, a raster background renders exactly as it did before the metadata existed: cropped to cover, centered.

`backgrounds.toml` is read by a small awk parser, not a full TOML implementation, so it recognizes a deliberate subset: `[section]` headers (bare or double-quoted) and `key = value` lines whose value is a bare token or a double-quoted string, with `#` comments. Arrays, inline tables, nested/dotted tables, and multi-line values are not interpreted. This keeps the resolver dependency-free — there is no TOML parser in Omarchy's base package set — at the cost of that expressiveness; author `backgrounds.toml` within the schema shown above rather than relying on general TOML features. A line that starts with `[` but is not a header Omarchy recognizes opens an inert section, so its keys never leak into the preceding one.

Backdrop selection happens after aspect-ratio variant selection and SVG rasterization. An `edge` backdrop therefore samples the actual per-screen asset rather than the canonical file, and its result is cached by resolved path, modification time, and fallback color. A theme can combine these tools deliberately: use `blur` for photography or paintings whose whole composition matters, `edge` for centered artwork on a mostly flat field, responsive SVG for layouts that genuinely reflow, and an `@variant` when the composition itself needs to change for a screen shape.

The blur and sampled-edge backdrop concepts were inspired by Thomas Feichtinger's MIT-licensed [Background Display for Omarchy](https://github.com/fchtngr/omarchy-background-display) plugin. Omarchy implements them here as per-background resolver metadata so they compose with per-screen variants, focal crops, responsive SVGs, transitions, and the lock screen rather than replacing the background service.

### Aspect-ratio variants

A regular file named `<stem>@<label>.<ext>` beside a background is an aspect-ratio variant of it: `forest@ultrawide.png` next to `forest.png`. The label is free-form and only the actual pixel dimensions matter. For each screen, the candidate — canonical file plus its variants — whose measured aspect ratio is closest to the screen's is displayed, closest meaning the smallest absolute difference between the logarithms of the two aspect ratios. The canonical file wins ties, a variant whose dimensions cannot be probed is skipped — while a canonical file that cannot be probed wins outright — and with no screen size to select against the canonical file is used.

The choosers hide every filename containing `@`, whether or not a canonical base file exists — an orphan like `mountains@2x.png` with no `mountains.png` beside it is simply invisible, so background filenames should only use `@` to mark variants. Variants never become the `current/background` symlink target; setting a background always means the canonical file, and variants share its `backgrounds.toml` section. The per-screen choice happens purely at render time, so different monitors on the same desktop can show different variants of the same background.

### SVG backgrounds

`.svg` files are valid backgrounds. When one is selected for a screen, it is rasterized with `rsvg-convert` — to cover size for `crop`, contain size for `fit`, and intrinsic size for `center` and `tile`, with `fill_color` as the rasterization background — and the resulting PNG is cached under `~/.cache/omarchy/background-renders/`, keyed by path, mtime, screen size, fill settings, SVG layout, and the renderer safety limits. The key also folds in a digest of the sibling files (name and mtime) in the SVG's directory, so an SVG that references a relative sibling asset is re-rasterized when that asset changes and not only when the SVG's own mtime moves; the tradeoff is that editing any file in a `backgrounds/` directory may invalidate that directory's SVG renders. Raster dimensions and total pixels are capped before conversion, and image conversion has a timeout, so a malformed or hostile downloaded theme cannot request an unbounded Cairo surface or leave a renderer running indefinitely. The render cache is bounded both by age (entries older than 30 days are pruned opportunistically) and by count (the oldest entries past a fixed cap are dropped), so it cannot grow without limit; the sampled-edge color cache under `~/.cache/omarchy/background-edge-colors/` is bounded the same way.

An SVG that opts into `svg_layout = "responsive"` is rendered through a temporary copy whose root `width`, `height`, and `viewBox` match the target screen. Root percentage coordinates then resolve against the actual monitor shape while nested SVG viewports can preserve the aspect ratio of logos and other fixed artwork. Relative sibling image references remain available during this render. The root is parsed as XML, so either quote style, whitespace around attribute assignments, and omitted viewport attributes are supported. Declaring all three root attributes is still recommended to make the nominal file directly viewable. Shell rasterization targets include the display scale so SVGs retain detail on HiDPI outputs.

A theme can also ship theme-colored SVG templates as `backgrounds/*.svg.tpl`. When the staged theme has a `colors.toml`, `omarchy-theme-set-templates` renders each one into the same directory under the same name minus `.tpl`, using the same placeholders as every other template (`{{ background }}`, `{{ accent }}`, and the rest), so the artwork picks up the active palette. The usual theme-file-wins rule applies — a template whose output name already exists is skipped — and the `.tpl` is removed from the staged theme after a successful render. Only theme-shipped templates are rendered; user overlay backgrounds directories are not part of the template pipeline.

### Resolution

`omarchy-theme-bg-resolve` (a hidden command) is the single implementation of metadata parsing, variant selection, and SVG rasterization. Both the CLI side and the shell's per-screen QML background layers call it; nothing else should reimplement the selection rule.

## Theme activation flow

`omarchy-theme-set <name>` builds a clean staging directory at
`~/.local/state/omarchy/current/next-theme`:

1. Copy the first-party theme from `themes/<name>/`.
2. Overlay `~/.config/omarchy/themes/<name>/`, in full when the user wrote it and filtered when it came from a git repo, naming anything it dropped on stderr.
3. If needed, generate `colors.toml` from `alacritty.toml`.
4. Run `omarchy-theme-set-templates` to render templates into the staging
   theme.
5. Move the staging theme into `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme`, write
   `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme.name`, and notify the running shell.

Template rendering only happens when the staged theme has `colors.toml`.
Existing files are never overwritten by a template, so a hand-written
`themes/<name>/shell.toml` or `hyprland.lua` wins over
`default/themed/shell.toml.tpl` or `hyprland.lua.tpl`.

User templates in `~/.config/omarchy/themed/*.tpl` are processed before the
built-in templates. If a user template has the same output filename as a
built-in template, the built-in output is skipped.

After activation, `omarchy-theme-set` fires the `theme-set` hook
(`~/.config/omarchy/hooks/theme-set*`, theme name in `$1`) and dispatches a
parallel retint of running apps — terminals, Hyprland, btop, browser, editors,
and the rest of the `post_theme_commands` list in `bin/omarchy-theme-set`.
Making a new app follow theme changes means adding its restart/retint command
to that list. Runs serialize on a `flock`, so scripted theme changes queue
instead of racing.

## What an installed theme may not ship

`themes/<name>/` in this repo is Omarchy's own code and is trusted. So is a theme the user wrote by hand in `~/.config/omarchy/themes/<name>/`: it is their machine and their file, and both stage in full.

`omarchy theme install <url>` is different. It clones a stranger's git repo straight into that same directory, so the contents are whatever the theme author pushed. `omarchy-theme-set` tells the two apart the way `omarchy-theme-extras` already does — a `.git` directory means it was cloned, while a plain directory or a symlink to a working copy is the user's own — and from a cloned one it drops only what can run code:

- any `*.lua` — Hyprland `require`s a theme's `hyprland.lua` and `gum_env.lua` at login, and Neovim loads its `neovim.lua` at startup
- `alacritty.toml`, `foot.ini`, `ghostty.conf`, `kitty.conf` — each names the program the terminal launches
- `vscode.json` — names the extension `omarchy-theme-set-vscode` installs, and a VS Code extension is arbitrary JavaScript

Symlinks are dropped with them, at any depth; in a cloned theme they point wherever the theme author chose. Everything a cloned theme ships that is colour is kept, including files Omarchy would otherwise have generated — `btop.theme`, `chromium.theme`, `helix.toml`, `shell.toml`, `icons.theme`, `keyboard.rgb` and the rest — so a theme can still say exactly how it wants each app to look. What is dropped gets generated from `default/themed/*.tpl` instead, and is named on stderr.

A denylist is only right while it is maintained. Adding a template for another terminal, or for another editor that loads Lua, means adding it to `INSTALLED_THEME_DENIED` in `bin/omarchy-theme-set`; `test/shell.d/theme-staging-test.sh` fails on any `default/themed/*.tpl` whose output is recorded as neither code nor colour, so a new template cannot be added without that decision being made.

A theme predating `colors.toml` is not left without a palette: its `alacritty.toml` is read through `omarchy-theme-colors-from-alacritty` into a scratch directory and only the resulting `colors.toml` is staged, so the colors survive and the terminal config does not.

The restriction lives in `omarchy-theme-set` rather than in `omarchy-theme-install` on purpose. Filtering at staging also covers themes installed before the rule existed and files a theme gains later through `omarchy theme update`.

What this does not cover: a theme distributed as an archive rather than a git repo, extracted into `~/.config/omarchy/themes/` by hand, is indistinguishable from one the user wrote and stages in full. `omarchy theme install` only takes git URLs, so the supported path is always filtered, but the check is a statement about where a theme came from and not a sandbox.

## `colors.toml`

`colors.toml` provides the palette keys used by templates. Keys are grouped
semantic-first: accent/selection/muted, then the backgrounds, then the
foregrounds, then the named colors:

```toml
mode = "dark"

accent = "#7aa2f7"
selection = "#292e42"
muted = "#414868"

background = "#1a1b26"
dark_background = "#13141c"
darker_background = "#0e0e14"
lighter_background = "#24283b"

foreground = "#a9b1d6"
dark_foreground = "#565f89"
light_foreground = "#b4bee6"
bright_foreground = "#c0caf5"

red = "#f7768e"
blue = "#7aa2f7"
```

Any key can be referenced from a template with `{{ key }}`. The foundational
shell palette is loaded from:

- `foreground` — primary readable text color
- `background` — primary background color
- `accent` — preferred when present; otherwise some places fall back to
  `color4`
- `muted` — de-emphasized elements (comments, placeholders, dividers); also
  serves as ANSI `color8`
- `red` / `color1` — populate the shell's urgent role; there is no `urgent`
  palette key (one defined in `colors.toml` is ignored)

Themes and user templates using the legacy short names remain supported.
Canonical names take precedence when both forms are defined, and resolved
canonical values are also exposed through their legacy names:

| Canonical | Legacy |
|-----------|--------|
| `background` | `bg` |
| `dark_background` | `dark_bg` |
| `darker_background` | `darker_bg` |
| `lighter_background` | `lighter_bg` |
| `foreground` | `fg` |
| `dark_foreground` | `dark_fg` |
| `light_foreground` | `light_fg` |
| `bright_foreground` | `bright_fg` |

The neutral ramp is centered on `background -> bright_foreground`. Dark themes
should read from darkest to lightest; light themes should read from lightest to
darkest. Terminal and editor cursors use `bright_foreground`; there is no
separate cursor palette key. `selection` is the text-selection background stop
in that ramp; Omarchy derives `selection_background = selection` and
`selection_foreground = bright_foreground`. Use
`omarchy dev theme-preview [theme]` to inspect that ramp, including
`dark_background`, `darker_background`, and a selected-text sample.

## Template placeholders

Templates are plain files ending in `.tpl`. `omarchy-theme-set-templates`
replaces placeholders with values from `colors.toml`.

### Color placeholders

For a color key such as `accent = "#7aa2f7"`:

| Placeholder | Output |
|-------------|--------|
| `{{ accent }}` | `#7aa2f7` |
| `{{ accent_strip }}` | `7aa2f7` |
| `{{ accent_rgb }}` | `122,162,247` |

### Color mixing

`mix`, `mix_strip`, and `mix_rgb` blend two hex colors by a fraction or
percentage:

```text
{{ mix background foreground 15% }}
{{ mix_strip background accent 0.35 }}
{{ mix_rgb color0 color7 50 }}
```

### Gradient helpers

Some theme keys can be either a solid color or a Hyprland-style gradient:

```toml
hyprland_active_border = "rgba(33ccffee) rgba(00ff99ee) 45deg"
```

Gradient helper placeholders understand those values:

| Helper | Use | Example output |
|--------|-----|----------------|
| `{{ hypr_gradient hyprland_active_border accent }}` | Hyprland Lua config | `{ colors = { "rgba(33ccffee)", "rgba(00ff99ee)" }, angle = 45 }` |
| `{{ shell_gradient hyprland_active_border accent }}` | shell border tokens | `rgba(33ccffee) rgba(00ff99ee) 45deg` |
| `{{ gradient_start hyprland_active_border accent }}` | flat-color-only consumers | `#33ccff` |

The second argument is a fallback. For example,
`{{ shell_gradient hyprland_active_border accent }}` means: use
`hyprland_active_border` if the theme defines it; otherwise use `accent`.
The helper does not choose the first color unless you use `gradient_start`.

## `shell.toml`

`shell.toml` contains shell surface roles, control states, spacing, typography,
and bar sizing. The default generated file comes from
`default/themed/shell.toml.tpl`.

Themes can override the entire generated file by shipping `shell.toml`, or just
one section by shipping `shell.<section>.toml`. For example,
`shell.lock.toml` replaces only the `[lock]` section after the default
`shell.toml` has been generated:

```toml
text        = "#ffffff"
placeholder = "#ffffff"
border      = "#ffffff"
```

The filename decides the target section, so the `[lock]` header is optional.

The running shell reads `shell.toml` into two QML singletons:

- `Color` for palette and surface roles like `Color.menu.border`.
- `Style` for controls, spacing, font scale, corner radius, and bar sizing.

### Borders

Shell border tokens accept either a solid color or a gradient in the same key:

```toml
[notifications]
border = "#7aa2f7"
```

or:

```toml
[notifications]
border = "rgba(33ccffee) rgba(00ff99ee) 45deg"
```

Do not add a separate `border-gradient` key for new themes. The parser still
accepts `border-gradient` and `*-border-gradient` for compatibility with older
configs, but the canonical form is the border key itself.

Border alphas apply to solid borders and to every gradient stop:

```toml
[notifications]
border       = "rgba(33ccffee) rgba(00ff99ee) 45deg"
border-alpha = 0.8
```

If a color stop already includes alpha, the stop alpha and `border-alpha` are
combined.

### Border widths

Border widths accept CSS-style lists:

```toml
border-width = 2          # all sides
border-width = "2 4"      # top/bottom, right/left
border-width = "2 4 6"    # top, right/left, bottom
border-width = "2 4 6 8"  # top, right, bottom, left
```

Per-side keys override the list:

```toml
[notifications]
border-width = 2
border-width-left = 6
```

That gives notifications a 2px border on the top, right, and bottom, and a 6px
left edge.

State-specific borders follow the same pattern. A selected menu row can use a
different width from the card border:

```toml
[menu]
selected-border = "accent"
selected-border-width = "1 1 1 4"
```

For state-specific surfaces such as lock and polkit, the token name prefixes
the width key:

```toml
[lock]
border-active = "rgba(33ccffee) rgba(00ff99ee) 45deg"
border-active-width-left = 6
```

### Control borders

`[controls]` governs shared controls such as buttons, dropdowns, text fields,
toggles, and cursor rows. Each state has a fill color, optional border value,
border width, and border alpha:

```toml
[controls]
normal-color        = "#a9b1d6"
normal-border       = "#a9b1d6"
normal-border-width = 1
normal-border-alpha = 0.4

hover-cursor-color        = "#a9b1d6"
hover-cursor-border       = "#a9b1d6"
hover-cursor-border-width = 1
hover-cursor-border-alpha = 0.25
```

The `*-border` keys can also be gradients:

```toml
[controls]
focus-border = "rgba(33ccffee) rgba(00ff99ee) 45deg"
focus-border-width = "2 2 2 4"
```

Set a border width to `0` to keep the fill but remove that state border.

### Surface sections

Common shell sections include:

- `[bar]`
- `[controls]`
- `[popups]`
- `[tooltip]`
- `[notifications]`
- `[launcher]`
- `[menu]`
- `[polkit]`
- `[lock]`
- `[image-picker]`
- `[spacing]`
- `[font]`

Clipboard and emojis inherit menu tokens. Popups are used by bar flyouts,
dropdowns, OSD, and popup cards.

## QML border API

Plugin and shell QML should use `BorderSurface` for theme-aware borders:

```qml
import qs.Commons
import qs.Ui

BorderSurface {
  color: Color.popups.background
  borderSpec: Border.surfaceSpec("popups", "border", Color.popups.border, 2)
  padding: Style.spacing.popupPadding

  Item {
    anchors.fill: parent
    anchors.topMargin: parent.contentTopInset
    anchors.rightMargin: parent.contentRightInset
    anchors.bottomMargin: parent.contentBottomInset
    anchors.leftMargin: parent.contentLeftInset
  }
}
```

Use `Border.surfaceSpec(section, token, fallbackColor, fallbackWidth, alphaKey)`
for shell theme tokens (the optional `alphaKey` names the alpha token, e.g.
`"border-alpha"`), `Border.controlSpec(state, foreground, accent, urgent)` for
shared controls, and `Border.flat(color, width)` for a deliberate local border
that should not be overridden by the active theme. `Color.<section>.border` is the
flat first-stop color for consumers that cannot render full border specs.

## Hyprland templates

Hyprland theme output is generated from `default/themed/hyprland.lua.tpl`.
Use `hypr_gradient` for border values because Hyprland's Lua config wants a
Lua string for solid colors and a Lua table for gradients:

```lua
local active_border_color = {{ hypr_gradient hyprland_active_border accent }}
```

For a solid fallback this renders:

```lua
local active_border_color = "#7aa2f7"
```

For a gradient it renders:

```lua
local active_border_color = { colors = { "rgba(33ccffee)", "rgba(00ff99ee)" }, angle = 45 }
```

## Adding or overriding theme files

- Add palette values to `themes/<name>/colors.toml`.
- Hand-written overrides work everywhere except a `.lua`, a terminal config or a `vscode.json` in a theme cloned from a git repo; see [What an installed theme may not ship](#what-an-installed-theme-may-not-ship).
- Prefer generated files when the theme can be expressed with templates.
- Add a hand-written file in `themes/<name>/` only when that theme needs to
  override the generated output entirely.
- Add a new built-in template under `default/themed/<file>.tpl` when every
  theme should generate that file.
- Add a user-wide template under `~/.config/omarchy/themed/<file>.tpl` when a
  local customization should apply across themes.

When changing templates or theme helpers, run focused tests such as:

```bash
./test/cli
./test/shell
```
