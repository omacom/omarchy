// Measures where an item's ink sits and how far it reaches. The item is
// rendered to a temporary image; ImageMagick reduces the render to the shape
// it paints, blurs that shape into one soft mass and cuts the mass at half
// its peak, then reports the box it occupies, the box of the same render
// turned 45° for the diagonals, and where its weight balances.
//
// The shape is taken before the blur, so how brightly a part was painted
// never changes where the icon is measured to be: a logo drawn in two tones
// measures the same as the same logo drawn in one. Boxes and centroids come
// back as fractions of their render, so they hold at any display size. One
// measurement runs at a time; a request made meanwhile replaces any earlier
// pending one.
