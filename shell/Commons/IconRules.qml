// Nothing else may carry its own idea of how far an icon sits from the edge
// of its canvas.
//
// An icon is sized by how far it reaches and placed by where it weighs.
// Those are two different questions and the old single answer — the box
// around the ink — got the second one wrong: it lines up the box, so a mark
// whose weight sits high in that box (an arc) rides high on the bar and one
// whose weight sits low (a body under a thin antenna) sags, even though
// every box is perfectly centered. Lining up the weight instead is what
// makes a row read as level.

  // Two different questions get two different measurements, and mixing them

  // the raw ink it paints; WHERE it sits comes from a blurred blob: the shape is smeared until it
  // reads as one soft mass, that mass is levelled against its own peak, and
  // cut in half. Levelling against its own peak rather than a fixed level is
  // what lets the blur be strong — a thin glyph blurs to a faint mass, and a
  // fixed cut erases it entirely. Being strong is the point: it finds where
  // the icon's weight really lies, and it drops a hairline that would
  // otherwise drag the whole icon off centre.
