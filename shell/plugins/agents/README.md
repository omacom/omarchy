# Agents

One bar icon and one panel for every AI coding subscription on the machine.
The panel is strictly a display: it watches the usage records that
`omarchy-agent-usage-update` writes to `~/.local/state/omarchy/agents/usage/`
and draws whatever appears there. `Panel.qml` owns the bar button and the
popup; `Main.qml` discovers and watches the records (and handles the optional
cross-device aggregation); `Agent.qml` is the per-record file watcher.

## Panel

- **Hero** — the mark, the tool, and the plan it runs on ("Max 20x", "Pro").
  Auth and endpoint problems replace the plan line and repeat in a card.
- **Subscription switch** — one chip per enabled agent (`h`/`l` or click).
  It appears only when more than one agent is enabled.
- **Limits** — the percentage of each allowance used, a matching meter, and
  the time until the session or weekly window resets.
- **Balance** — prepaid agents report a credit ledger instead of limits:
  remaining credit, a fuel-gauge meter that drains toward empty, and
  funded-versus-spent detail.
- **Tokens by day** — one row per day for the last week: day, bar, tokens, with today
  bolded at the bottom. Hover today for its prompt and session count.
- **Tokens by model** — tokens per model with the bar behind each row scaled
  to the heaviest model,
  the same way the weekly chart scales to its busiest day. Hover for the
  input / output / cache split.

A subscription appears only when it is enabled in settings and has actually
recorded usage — on this machine or on a synced one. With one such agent
there is no switch row at all; with none, the module leaves the bar entirely
rather than sitting there with nothing to say. A CLI installed mid-session
shows up at the next refresh, so nothing polls the disk waiting for it.

That self-hiding is why the widget ships in the default bar layout: a machine
that has never run an AI coding agent draws nothing, and the icon arrives on
its own the first time a scan finds usage. Drop it with
`omarchy plugin disable omarchy.agents`.

## Data

Each agent is one JSON record in `~/.local/state/omarchy/agents/usage/`,
written by `omarchy-agent-usage-update`. That command runs one
`omarchy-agent-usage-<agent>` collector per agent; the widget invokes it
on its refresh timer and whenever you ask for a refresh, and picks up any
record that lands in the directory regardless of who wrote it.

Adding an agent therefore never touches this plugin: ship a collector that
prints the record contract (see the `claude` and `codex` collectors in
`bin/`), and the panel gains a tab. An `assets/<id>.svg` mark is optional —
with an `assets/<id>-light.svg` twin if the mark needs a dark variant for
light surfaces — and the bar glyph stands in when there is none.

| Collector | Limits | Local stats |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint (5-hour session + 7-day weekly) | `~/.claude/projects` transcripts, opencode sessions on an Anthropic provider, plus `stats-cache.json` and `history.jsonl` as fallback |
| `codex` | The Codex app-server RPC | native Codex CLI session files (plus pi and opencode sessions) |
| `grok` | The weekly credit allowance from grok's ACP billing method (or its log), when the reading includes a percentage | `~/.grok/sessions` transcripts |
| `fireworks` | Estimated prepaid balance: configured funding minus rated account costs | Fireworks billing API, grouped by day and model for the last 30 days |

Claude limits need a signed-in CLI; without credentials the panel says so and
falls back to local stats only. A non-default Claude directory is honored via
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, Codex via `CODEX_HOME`, Grok via `GROK_HOME`. Fireworks reads
`FIREWORKS_API_KEY` and `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID` first, then
`~/.fireworks/auth.ini` (which `firectl set-api-key` creates), then the key
opencode stores in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` when Fireworks is
signed in there.

### Grok credits

The plan and the weekly allowance come from grok's own ACP `_x.ai/billing`
method, asked over `grok agent stdio`. Grok owns that call, so the collector
never reads `auth.json` and never talks to an xAI endpoint itself — the same
boundary the Codex collector keeps.

`_x.ai/billing` is a vendor extension with no stability promise, and from
here a method grok has renamed looks the same as a grok that is signed out.
Grok also logs the config it fetched at startup, so the newest usable reading
in `~/.grok/logs/unified.jsonl` stands in when the call says nothing. That
fallback matches on a log message, which is the more brittle of the two —
hence the fallback rather than the source. The plan and the meter are filled
independently, so an answer that carries one but not the other keeps what it
gave.

A usable reading is a percentage that belongs to a period that is still open,
and neither half is guaranteed. A reading from a closed week is the wrong
week's number, and a window with no percentage in it is not a meter of zero —
it is no meter. Either way the meter is omitted rather than guessed, and the
tab shows tokens only.

That omission is not hypothetical: grok 1.0.0 stopped reporting the
percentage for every reading, where 0.2.118 had carried one in 100 of 102 on
the same account. It came back in 1.0.5, and the meter lit up again on its
own — which is the behaviour to expect the next time the field moves.

The same reply carries `prepaidBalance`, `onDemandCap`, and `onDemandUsed`,
each as a `{"val": N}` object. None of them feed the panel's balance ledger:
they read `0` on every account this has been seen on, and nothing in the reply
names a unit, so credits, dollars, and cents are indistinguishable at zero.
Mapping them would mean guessing the scale of a number nobody has yet seen be
non-zero, and the failure mode of guessing wrong is a confidently wrong
balance rather than a missing one.

Worth knowing when reading the panel: the meter and the token chart do not
agree and cannot be made to. Grok's transcripts are overwhelmingly cache
reads, and the allowance is billed per X identity rather than per machine, so
usage from the web or another box lands in the meter with nothing local to
explain it.

### Fireworks balance

The collector first asks the account's `:getBalance` endpoint for the real
prepaid ledger. That endpoint exists but is permission-gated, and as of
August 2026 no console-issued API key passes it — Fireworks appears to
reserve it for the dashboard session. The probe stays because it is cheap
and the live figure lights up automatically if Fireworks ever opens it to
keys. Until then the collector falls back to estimating the balance from
configuration in `~/.config/omarchy/agents/fireworks.json`:

```json
{
  "accountId": "",
  "fundedAmount": 20,
  "fundedAt": "2026-07-01"
}
```

Set `fundedAmount` to the credits purchased and optionally `fundedAt` to the
purchase date; with no date, the collector uses the account creation time. It
subtracts rated account costs and the panel labels the result as estimated.
For a later top-up, increase `fundedAmount` by the new credit while keeping
the original `fundedAt`, so both the funding and spend still cover the same
period. `accountId` only matters when one API key can access several
accounts. Without a configured `fundedAmount` the tab still shows token
usage, just no balance. With a live ledger, `fundedAmount` is optional and
only adds the meter and the spent-of-funded line under the real figure.

## Interactions

- Bar icon: left = panel, right = launch agent, middle = next subscription.
- Panel: `h`/`l` switch subscription, `j`/`k` scroll, `r` or Enter refresh,
  Tab moves to the neighboring bar panel, Esc closes.
- IPC: `omarchy-shell omarchy.agents <open|close|toggle|refresh|next>`.

## Settings

Settings live in the widget's entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`. The
top-level keys can be set with
`omarchy bar set omarchy.agents <key> <value>`:

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `refreshIntervalSec` | `900` | How often the usage records regenerate |
| `syncMode` | `"Off"` | `"On"` writes this machine's snapshot and merges the others |
| `syncDir` | `""` | A folder synced by Syncthing, Dropbox, rsync, … |
| `syncFileName` | `<hostname>.json` | This machine's snapshot file |
| `syncDeviceId` | hostname | Stable device name inside the snapshot |

Numbers need `--json`, or they land in `shell.json` as strings:

```bash
omarchy bar set omarchy.agents refreshIntervalSec 300 --json
omarchy bar set omarchy.agents syncDir '~/Sync/agent-usage'
```

Per-agent enablement is nested, and `set` writes its key literally rather
than walking a dotted path — so pass the whole `providers` object as JSON (or
edit `shell.json` directly):

```bash
omarchy bar set omarchy.agents providers '{
  "claude": { "enabled": true },
  "codex": { "enabled": false },
  "grok": { "enabled": true },
  "fireworks": { "enabled": true }
}' --json
```

`enabled` defaults to `true` for every discovered agent; set it to `false` to
hide a subscription that is installed. Disabled agents are also skipped when
the records regenerate.

With `syncMode` on, every `*.json` snapshot in `syncDir` is merged, so today,
the last 7 days, and the all-time totals cover every machine you code on —
active days are unioned by date rather than summed. Rate limits stay
per-account and are never merged. A record may declare `"scope": "account"`
when its stats are account-global rather than machine-local (Fireworks'
billing API); those merge by taking the widest value instead of summing, so
the same account synced from two machines is not counted twice.

One caveat on "all-time": the Codex collector only reads native session files
touched in the last 30 days, and Fireworks requests the last 30 days from its
billing API, so their totals and day counts cover that window. Claude's cover
every transcript still on disk.
