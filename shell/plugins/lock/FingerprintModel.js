// Retry pacing and the availability signal for the lock screen's fingerprint
// loop. The signal is whether an attempt reached the reader at all: pam_fprintd
// relays a "place your finger" prompt only once the claim has landed and the
// verify is live, so an attempt that ends without ever prompting never reached
// the device -- it is wedged (a verify killed by suspend), held by another
// client, or gone. Those are what the backoff paces and the notice reports. An
// attempt that did prompt proves the reader works (the user simply has not
// swiped yet), so it clears the streak and the loop stays responsive.
//
// A finger that merely fails to match still prompted, so it resets too and
// retries fast. Consecutive unreached attempts back off exponentially to a
// ceiling above fprintd's 30-second idle exit, so a claim wedged without the
// resume hook clearing it can still recover once the retries let fprintd idle
// out.
