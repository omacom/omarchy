# Shared BCM43602 5 GHz NVRAM helpers for the install leaf and the migration.
#
# linux-firmware-broadcom ships the BCM43602 chip firmware but not a board
# calibration file. Without one, brcmfmac brings the card up with placeholder
# 5 GHz values (aa5g=1, no per-channel tx-power tables) and only 2.4 GHz
# networks are visible.
#
# The NVRAM is a community dump (kernel.org bugzilla attachment 290569) with
# ccode=00 / regrev=245, which defers channel legality to the host. Omarchy
# already persists that from the timezone via set-wireless-regdom.sh. It is
# calibration for one board, not every Apple BCM43602: this only runs on the
# 2017 Touch Bar MacBook Pros (MacBookPro14,2 / 14,3) where the dump has been
# seen to work. MacBookPro13,3 is the same PCI ID and is excluded — a report
# of this dump on that model described unusable range.
#
# Destinations live under /usr/lib/firmware/updates so they override, and do
# not collide with, linux-firmware-broadcom. A file already at either the
# override path or the packaged path when this runs wins, user-placed or
# package-shipped. Once this copy is installed the override path is searched
# first, so a board file linux-firmware ships later does not replace it.
