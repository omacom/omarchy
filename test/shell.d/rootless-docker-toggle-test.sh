# Rootless Docker runs a per-user daemon next to the system one. Setup installs
# the rootless pieces, keeps the daemon alive with linger, enables the packaged
# user unit, and selects it through a docker context (not DOCKER_HOST, so
# `sudo docker` keeps reaching the system daemon). A failure after enabling the
# unit disables it again, so a rerun and the menu don't take it for finished.
# Remove cleans up whatever is left and leaves the system daemon alone, as well
# as a `rootless` context that points to another daemon.
