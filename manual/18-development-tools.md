# Development Tools

## Alternative Editors

Omarchy ships with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) by default, but if you'd like something a bit more mainstream and familiar, you can run the Omarchy Menu (`Super + Space`) and see the options under _Install > Editor_. We have VSCode, Cursor, Zed, Sublime Text, Helix, Vim, and Emacs listed there. If you don't find what you're looking for, checkout _Install > Package_, and see if it isn't in an Arch package (and if not, try _Install > AUR_ to check the AUR).

The original `vi` editor is also available out of the box. Run `vi filename` to edit a file in the terminal.

Theme matching is offered for `VSCode`, `Cursor`, `VSCodium`, and `Helix`.

You can set the system-wide default editor under `Setup > Defaults > Editor`.

## Environment

Omarchy supports setting up a whole host of development environments through the _Install > Development_ section of the Omarchy Menu (`Super + Space`). You'll of course find _Ruby on Rails_, but also all three major runtimes for JavaScript (Node.js, Bun, Deno), as well as popular PHP frameworks like Laravel and Symfony. Oh, and there's Go, Rust, Python, Java, Elixir (with Phoenix), .NET, OCaml, Zig, Clojure, and Scala too. It's a very broad selection!

The majority of these environments are managed by [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/). It's a tool that lets you install and run multiple versions of a programming language on the same machine. It's like rbenv or rvm for Ruby or virtualenv for Python, but it works for a bunch of different environments.

To install, say, Ruby, you'd run `mise use -g ruby`, which will both install Ruby and set it as the global default. Or, if your project has a .ruby-version file, you can just run `mise i` in the root of that project.

## Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) hardly needs any introduction. It allows you to run isolated containers, and Omarchy installs everything needed to run it well, including Docker itself and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

By default your user is *not* in the `docker` group. That group is effectively passwordless root — anything in it can `docker run -v /:/host` and take over the machine — so a single rogue script or dependency running as you would otherwise be one command away from root. So on the command line you run Docker with `sudo` (`sudo docker ps`, `sudo docker compose up`), and the graphical tools that talk to the daemon — the Docker TUI on `Super + Shift + D` and the Windows VM — ask for authorization when they need it. If you want the convenience of a groupless setup back and understand the tradeoff, enable it from **Setup > Security > Sudoless Docker** (or run `omarchy-setup-security-sudoless-docker`), which adds you to the `docker` group after a warning; then plain `docker` and the `d` alias work without `sudo` again.

Remember to checkout the Lazydocker command to manage your containers in a cool TUI using `Super + Shift + D`; it asks for authorization the first time unless you have enabled sudoless Docker.

You can set up MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, MariaDB, or SQL Server for local development using _Install > Development > Docker DB_ in the Omarchy menu. Each fresh container gets an independent generated administrator password; the installer passes it through a private Docker env/config file rather than command arguments. Recover the credentials from `~/.config/omarchy/docker-dbs/`, whose directory and files are accessible only to your account. The database ports remain bound to `127.0.0.1`, but authentication is still required because every local account shares the host loopback interface.

New MongoDB containers use the maintained MongoDB 7.0 image series for compatibility with current Linux kernels. Existing containers and their data are left intact; the installer does not upgrade or downgrade an existing database.

The installer never replaces an existing named database container. Containers created by an older Omarchy version may still have empty, trust-based, absent, or publicly known administrator credentials. Back up their data and change authentication with that database's administration tools, or deliberately remove and reinstall the container once you have decided how to preserve its data.

## GitHub CLI

[The GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) let's you authenticate with your GitHub account and clone private repositories using it. It's wired up as one of the lazy-loading mise stubs, so the first time you run `gh`, it installs itself. To authenticate, run `gh auth login`. Then you can checkout private repositories using `gh repo clone org/repo`.

You can also perform a bunch of other GitHub operations using this command. Just run `gh` to see everything that's possible.

There's a lazy-installing stub for `ghui` for managing your pull requests in a TUI too. And [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is preinstalled, if you'd like to drive git itself from a TUI as well.
