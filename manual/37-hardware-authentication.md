# Hardware authentication

### Fingerprint authentication

A lot of laptops come with a fingerprint sensor to do authentication. You can use this with Omarchy by running _Setup > Security > Fingerprint_ in the Omarchy menu (`Super + Space`).

That'll install the fingerprint driver for your reader, collect your print, verify it, and you'll be set to go using your fingerprint to unlock from the lock screen (which you can trigger with `Super + Ctrl + L`), enter sudo mode, and authorize system prompts.

Omarchy picks the right driver for the reader: most sensors use the open `libfprint` driver, while Validity and Synaptics readers like the one in the ThinkPad T480 use the `python-validity` driver from the AUR automatically. Either way the setup command works the same — hold your finger on the sensor through the prompts.

When your laptop lid is closed, the fingerprint prompt is automatically skipped, so you go straight to the password prompt instead of waiting on a sensor you can't reach. If you otherwise need to work on an external keyboard that doesn't have a sensor, just hit `CTRL + C`, when you're prompted for your fingerprint during `sudo`.

You can remove the fingerprint authentication under _Remove > Security > Fingerprint_ in the Omarchy menu.

### Fido2 authentication

If you're using a Fido2 device, you can set it up for `sudo` authentication using _Setup > Security > Fido2_ in the Omarchy menu (`Super + Space`). It covers `sudo` and system authorization prompts, though, not unlocking your computer.

You can remove the fido2 authentication under _Remove > Security > Fido2_ in the Omarchy menu.
