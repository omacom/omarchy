# Mac support

Omarchy has built-in support for **Intel Macs**. There are a couple of known limitations at the moment, but as long as you're aware and OK with those; you can breathe some new life into your old Macs by loading Omarchy.

Please note that installing on an M-series Mac is not directly supported at this time. You can find out more about the state of this in #omarchy-on-other in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tXFUdasqhY).

In a simple test, we were able to achieve 36% performance gains on a 2019 MacBook Pro just by installing Omarchy.

### Installing Omarchy on Mac

Omarchy only supports being the **only** OS installed at the moment. During the installation, the drive will be wiped and MacOS will no longer be bootable.

You can still restore it later via Internet Recovery if you'd like.

For the sake of this part, we'll assume you've already reviewed [Getting Started](02-getting-started.md) and have your USB drive ready. If you don't go ahead and do that now.

#### Disable Secure Boot

It is necessary to disable Apple's Secure Boot in order to boot the bootable USB, as well as the OS. To disable it, perform the following:

1. Turn off your Mac
2. Turn it on and _immediately_ press and hold Command-R until you see the loading screen appear
3. Select your user and enter your password if prompted
4. Once in the recovery screen, choose **Utilities > Startup Security Utility** from the menubar
5. Enter your password when prompted to authenticate
6. Choose "No Security" from the Secure Boot options
7. Choose "Allow booting from external or removable media" from the External Boot options

#### Start the Installation

1. Insert the USB drive
2. Restart your Mac and _immediately_ press and hold Option until you see a screen of boot devices
3. Select the orange EFI Boot device
4. Proceed with the [install as normal](02-getting-started.md)

The installer detects Mac hardware and applies the needed fixes automatically: Broadcom Wi-Fi drivers and firmware (including 5 GHz board calibration on supported 2016–2017 Touch Bar MacBook Pros), the SPI keyboard driver on the MacBook models that need it, and an NVMe suspend fix when Omarchy is installed on the internal NVMe drive.

The BCM43602 calibration keeps the required MAC-address field populated. When no usable address is discoverable, the installer derives a stable local address from the installation's machine ID; installation stops without writing firmware if that ID is missing or invalid. Cloned installations must have distinct machine IDs to avoid sharing the same fallback address. Existing calibration files are preserved, so updating Omarchy does not silently change an already-installed Wi-Fi identity.

### Known Limitations

Members of the community are constantly working on solutions to these challenges so if these are problematic for you, join #omarchy-on-other in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tXFUdasqhY) and see if there's any up-to-date methods for resolving these.

#### Devices with T1 Chip

The Apple T1 chip was introduced in late 2016 and used exclusively in the first-generation MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar.
- MacBook Pro 13-inch (2016, two Thunderbolt 3 ports) – Model: A1706
- MacBook Pro 13-inch (2016, four Thunderbolt 3 ports) – Model: A1708
- MacBook Pro 15-inch (2016) – Model: A1707

#### Known Issues

- T1 Touch Bar support is currently automatic only on the hardware-validated MacBookPro13,3. Omarchy installs the `apple-ib-drv-dkms` driver with its ACPI power call disabled; forcing `skip_acpi_power=0` can hard-freeze these Macs.
- Sound is not configured automatically.

On MacBookPro13,3, the Touch Bar provides Esc, brightness, keyboard-backlight, media, and volume controls by default; holding Fn switches it to F1–F12. The same iBridge USB configuration keeps the FaceTime HD camera available. After a kernel update, verify `dkms status apple-ib-drv` lists the new kernel before relying on the Touch Bar.

On MacBookPro13,3 systems with the Radeon Pro 460, Omarchy pins only the VRAM clock to its highest performance level as an experimental stability workaround. A small monitor reapplies the mask when it detects changed power-management state during compositor startup or later session transitions. The GPU core and PCIe link can still scale down, but the fixed VRAM clock uses more power at idle than fully automatic power management. This does not prevent every Radeon lockup or repair suspend. If GPU controls become unreadable or reapplying the mask fails, the monitor stops until its next service start instead of repeatedly accessing a failed GPU.

#### Devices with T2 Chip

The Apple T2 Security Chip was introduced in 2017. The T2 chip was discontinued with the transition to Apple silicon (M-series chips) starting in 2020.

- iMac Pro (2017) – Model: A1862
- MacBook Pro 13-inch (2018, four Thunderbolt 3 ports) – Model: A1989
- MacBook Pro 15-inch (2018) – Model: A1990
- MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2018) – Model: A1932
- Mac mini (2018) – Model: A1998
- MacBook Pro 13-inch (2019, two Thunderbolt 3 ports) – Model: A2159
- MacBook Pro 13-inch (2019, four Thunderbolt 3 ports) – Model: A2178
- MacBook Pro 15-inch (2019) – Model: A1990
- MacBook Pro 13-inch (2020, two Thunderbolt 3 ports) – Model: A2265
- MacBook Pro 15-inch (2020) – Model: A1990

On these models, the installer automatically sets up the patched `linux-t2` kernel, the T2 audio configuration, Apple's Broadcom Wi-Fi/Bluetooth firmware, and fan control via `t2fanrd`. The Touch Bar runs on the kernel's built-in Boot Camp-style support.
