# Mac support

Omarchy has built-in support for **Intel Macs**. There are a couple of known limitations at the moment, but as long as you're aware and OK with those; you can breathe some new life into your old Macs by loading Omarchy.

Please note that installing on an M-series Mac is not directly supported at this time. You can find out more about the state of this in #omarchy-on-other in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tXFUdasqhY).

In a simple test, we were able to achieve 36% performance gains on a 2019 MacBook Pro just by installing Omarchy.

### Installing Omarchy on Mac

Omarchy only supports being the **only** OS installed at the moment. During the installation, the drive will be wiped and MacOS will no longer be bootable.

You can still restore it later via Internet Recovery if you'd like.

For the sake of this part, we'll assume you've already reviewed [Getting Started](02-getting-started.md) and have your USB drive ready. If you don't go ahead and do that now.

#### Disable Secure Boot

It is necessary to disable Apple's Secure Boot in order to boot the bootable USB, as well as the OS. To disable it, perform the following:

1. Turn off your Mac
2. Turn it on and _immediately_ press and hold Command-R until you see the loading screen appear
3. Select your user and enter your password if prompted
4. Once in the recovery screen, choose **Utilities > Startup Security Utility** from the menubar
5. Enter your password when prompted to authenticate
6. Choose "No Security" from the Secure Boot options
7. Choose "Allow booting from external or removable media" from the External Boot options

#### Start the Installation

1. Insert the USB drive
2. Restart your Mac and _immediately_ press and hold Option until you see a screen of boot devices
3. Select the orange EFI Boot device
4. Proceed with the [install as normal](02-getting-started.md)

The installer detects Mac hardware and applies the needed fixes automatically: Broadcom Wi-Fi drivers and firmware, the SPI keyboard driver on the MacBook models that need it, and an NVMe suspend fix for those same models.

### Known Limitations

Members of the community are constantly working on solutions to these challenges so if these are problematic for you, join #omarchy-on-other in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tXFUdasqhY) and see if there's any up-to-date methods for resolving these.

#### Devices with T1 Chip

The Apple T1 chip was introduced in late 2016 and used exclusively in the first-generation MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar.
- MacBook Pro 13-inch (2016, two Thunderbolt 3 ports) – Model: A1706
- MacBook Pro 13-inch (2016, four Thunderbolt 3 ports) – Model: A1708
- MacBook Pro 15-inch (2016) – Model: A1707

#### Known Issues

- Touch Bar is non-functional
- Internal speakers are silent with the mainline CS8409 codec. PipeWire can show a live analog sink with volume up and still produce no sound.

On at least MacBookPro13,2 (2016 13-inch with Touch Bar), speakers work after installing the [davidjo/snd_hda_macbookpro](https://github.com/davidjo/snd_hda_macbookpro) DKMS driver:

```bash
omarchy pkg add wget linux-omarchy-headers base-devel dkms git
git clone https://github.com/davidjo/snd_hda_macbookpro.git
cd snd_hda_macbookpro
sudo ./install.cirrus.driver.sh -i
sudo reboot
```

Use `omarchy pkg add` / `omarchy update` rather than `pacman -Syu`. The install script downloads matching kernel source from kernel.org, so it needs network and `wget`. After a kernel update, DKMS rebuilds the module, downloading that kernel's source again. Keep the cloned `snd_hda_macbookpro` directory where it is: the installer links `/usr/src/snd_hda_macbookpro-0.1` to it rather than copying it, so deleting or moving the clone breaks the rebuild. Reboot after installing so the patched module attaches in place of the in-tree one.

Success looks like `dkms status` showing `snd_hda_macbookpro` installed for the running kernel, `modinfo -n snd_hda_codec_cs8409` pointing at `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/updates/dkms/`, and `dmesg` containing `trying APPLE`. The ALSA device name becomes `CS8409/CS42L83 Analog`. This is an optional out-of-tree module (it taints the kernel); it is not installed by default.

#### Devices with T2 Chip

The Apple T2 Security Chip was introduced in 2017. The T2 chip was discontinued with the transition to Apple silicon (M-series chips) starting in 2020.

- iMac Pro (2017) – Model: A1862
- MacBook Pro 13-inch (2018, four Thunderbolt 3 ports) – Model: A1989
- MacBook Pro 15-inch (2018) – Model: A1990
- MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2018) – Model: A1932
- Mac mini (2018) – Model: A1998
- MacBook Pro 13-inch (2019, two Thunderbolt 3 ports) – Model: A2159
- MacBook Pro 13-inch (2019, four Thunderbolt 3 ports) – Model: A2178
- MacBook Pro 15-inch (2019) – Model: A1990
- iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2020) – Model: A2115 (iMac20,1 and iMac20,2)
- MacBook Pro 13-inch (2020, two Thunderbolt 3 ports) – Model: A2265
- MacBook Pro 15-inch (2020) – Model: A1990

On these models, the installer automatically sets up the patched `linux-t2` kernel, the T2 audio configuration, Apple's Broadcom Wi-Fi/Bluetooth firmware, and fan control via `t2fanrd`. The Touch Bar runs on the kernel's built-in Boot Camp-style support.
