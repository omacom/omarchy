# Notices

You can quickly access the date and time, battery status, and current weather using the hotkey notices.

### Notification position

Notifications appear in the top-right corner by default. To move them, add an
entry to the `plugins` array in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`:

```json
{ "id": "omarchy.notifications", "position": "bottom-right" }
```

Supported positions are `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, and
`bottom-right`. Changes apply on save. Missing or invalid positions use
`top-right`.

New notifications appear below the stack at the top of the screen, or above
it at the bottom.

### Date & Time

`Super + Ctrl + Alt + T`

The location is detected from your IP address, which is usually close enough, but not always. You can pin it down with `omarchy weather location --set Malibu`, or be exact about it by adding coordinates: `omarchy weather location --set Malibu 34.0259,-118.7798`. Run `omarchy weather location` on its own to see where it thinks you are, and `--clear` to go back to auto-detection.

### Battery

`Super + Ctrl + Alt + B`
