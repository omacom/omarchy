# Keyboard, Mouse, Trackpad

Hyprland lets you configure all your inputs in great detail. You can change the keyboard repeat to be supersonically fast or make the trackpad use natural scrolling. You change all of it in `~/.config/hypr/input.lua`, which you can also reach via _Setup > Input_ in the Omarchy menu (`Super + Space`). Anything you set there replaces Omarchy's defaults.

Here's an example:

```lua
hl.config({
  input = {
    -- Use multiple keyboard layouts and switch between them with Left Alt + Right Alt
    kb_layout = "us,dk",
    kb_options = "compose:caps,shift:both_capslock_cancel,grp:alts_toggle",

    -- Change speed of keyboard repeat
    repeat_rate = 40,
    repeat_delay = 600,

    -- Increase sensitivity for mouse/trackpad (default: 0)
    sensitivity = 0.35,

    touchpad = {
      -- Use natural (inverse) scrolling
      natural_scroll = true,

      -- Use two-finger clicks for right-click instead of lower-right corner
      clickfinger_behavior = true,

      -- Control the speed of your scrolling
      scroll_factor = 0.3,
    },
  },
})

-- Scroll faster in the terminal
o.window("(Alacritty|kitty|foot)", { scroll_touchpad = 1.5 })
```

You can [see all the input options](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Basics/Variables/#input) on the Hyprland wiki for inputs.

By default, Omarchy uses CapsLock as the compose key for [quick emojis](07-hotkeys.md#quick-emojis) and [other completions](07-hotkeys.md#quick-completions). If you'd rather use CapsLock as Caps Lock, move the compose key elsewhere by changing `compose:caps` in `kb_options`. For example, this moves the compose key to Right Alt:

```lua
hl.config({
  input = {
    kb_options = "compose:ralt",
  },
})
```

### Trackpad gestures

You can also turn on [touchpad gestures](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Advanced-and-Cool/Gestures/), like swiping with three fingers to change workspaces:

```lua
hl.gesture({ fingers = 3, direction = "horizontal", action = "workspace" })
```

On Dell XPS laptops with a haptic touchpad, you can also set the click strength to low, mid, or high under _Trigger > Hardware > Touchpad Haptics_.

### Typing in Chinese, Japanese, and other languages

Omarchy runs the [fcitx5](https://fcitx-im.org/) input method framework as part of every session — it's what powers the CapsLock compose sequences. That means the plumbing for non-Latin input is already in place: install an input engine like `fcitx5-mozc` (Japanese) or `fcitx5-chinese-addons` (Chinese) with `omarchy pkg add`, plus `fcitx5-configtool` to add the engine to your input methods and set the key that switches between them.

### Typing in Traditional Chinese

Traditional Chinese is one step away: pick _Setup > Input Method > Chewing (Traditional Chinese)_ in the Omarchy menu (or run `omarchy setup input chewing`), and Omarchy installs the [fcitx5-chewing](https://github.com/fcitx/fcitx5-chewing) engine and adds it to your input methods. You keep typing English until Ctrl+Space toggles Bopomofo on and off. Caps Lock stays the compose key, as on every other layout.

Chewing reads Bopomofo off the standard arrangement. If you learned Hsu, ETen or one of the others, run `omarchy pkg add fcitx5-configtool` and start it with `fcitx5-configtool` from a terminal, since Omarchy hides it from the application launcher. Select Chewing under _Input Method_ and set its keyboard arrangement there.

Fcitx5 also watches for a tap of the left Shift key to switch back to English, which is what most people who grew up on Windows expect. That tap does not reach it under Omarchy's default `kb_options`, because `shift:both_capslock_cancel` gives the Shift keys a two-level mapping whose release reports `Caps_Lock` rather than `Shift_L`. Drop that option in `~/.config/hypr/input.lua` if you want the Shift toggle, and Ctrl+Space keeps working either way:

```lua
hl.config({
  input = {
    kb_options = "compose:caps",
  },
})
```

### Use ALT as SUPER

On some keyboards, it's not convenient to use the primary meta key (Windows/cmd key) as SUPER. You can change this to be ALT instead using this change:

```lua
hl.config({
  input = {
    kb_options = "compose:caps,shift:both_capslock_cancel,altwin:swap_alt_win",
  },
})
```
