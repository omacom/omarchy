# Omarchy Shell: Bar, Plugins, and Idle

Read this before changing the status bar, notifications, shell plugins,
widgets, or idle/lock behavior.

The bar, notification daemon, settings panel, and assorted overlays all run
inside a single long-running Quickshell process (`omarchy-shell`).

```
~/.config/omarchy/shell.json             # User overrides: bar, plugins, idle
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/<plugin-id>/   # User-owned shell plugins
$OMARCHY_PATH/config/omarchy/shell.json  # Canonical defaults
```

The shell hot-reloads `shell.json` on save — no restart needed for layout
changes. `idle.screensaver` and `idle.lock` are seconds since user idle began.

**Commands:** `omarchy restart shell`, `omarchy refresh shell`

## Bar Layout

Use the `omarchy bar` group to move and manage widgets:

```bash
omarchy bar move omarchy.clock --section right
```

For layout edits beyond what the commands cover, edit the bar configuration
in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`; it hot-reloads on save.

## Customizing Built-In Plugins and Widgets

To customize a built-in bar widget, never edit `$OMARCHY_PATH/shell/plugins/`.
Clone it into the user plugin directory instead:

```bash
omarchy plugin clone omarchy.workspaces
# Edit ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/<username>.workspaces/
```

Cloning switches the bar to the cloned copy (e.g. `<username>.workspaces`),
which is yours to edit and survives updates.

Saving a file under `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/` rescans the plugins, as does `omarchy-shell shell rescanPlugins`. A service whose `manifest.json` sets `"keepLoaded": true` (notifications, lock and idle, and their clones) keeps its running instance across a rescan, so changes to its code need `omarchy restart shell`. Other plugins can also keep running their old code after a rescan; if an edit does not appear, run `omarchy restart shell`.

## Idle and Lock

Set `idle.screensaver` and `idle.lock` in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`,
in seconds since user idle began. Example: "lock after ten minutes" means
setting `idle.lock` to `600`.
