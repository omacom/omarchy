# Themes, Backgrounds, and Fonts

Read this before changing themes, backgrounds, fonts, or theme colors.

## Theme Commands

```bash
omarchy theme list              # Show available themes
omarchy theme current           # Show current theme
omarchy theme set <name>        # Apply theme ("Tokyo Night" and "tokyo-night" both work)
omarchy theme bg next           # Cycle background
omarchy theme install <url>     # Install from git repo
```

## Making a New Theme

1. Create a directory under `~/.config/omarchy/themes`.
2. See how an existing theme is done via `/usr/share/omarchy/themes/catppuccin`.
3. Download a matching background (or several) from the internet and put them in `~/.config/omarchy/themes/<name-of-new-theme>/backgrounds/`.
4. When done with the theme, run `omarchy theme set "Name of new theme"`.

Additional user backgrounds for any theme (stock or custom) go in
`~/.config/omarchy/backgrounds/<theme-slug>/`.

## Theme Scope vs Global Settings

A theme should only change state that belongs to that theme: colors, backgrounds,
icons, generated app styling, and theme-owned `shell.toml` appearance.

Do not use global user settings to make a theme look right unless the user
explicitly asks for a machine-wide change:

- `omarchy font set <name>` changes the user's global font configuration and
  terminal configs. The selected font persists across theme switches.
- Bar position and layout live under `bar` in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json` and
  persist across theme switches. A theme's `shell.toml` may style and size the
  bar, but it does not own that layout.
- `~/.config/omarchy/shell.toml` is a machine-level shell override merged over
  the active theme. Its values intentionally survive theme switches.

When building or editing a theme, keep theme-specific choices inside the theme
unless the user clearly wants a persistent global preference too.

## What a Theme Installed From a Repo May Not Contain

A theme the user wrote by hand in `~/.config/omarchy/themes` is unrestricted, as
are Omarchy's own themes. From a theme cloned by `omarchy theme install`, Omarchy
drops only what runs code: any `*.lua` (Hyprland requires a theme's
`hyprland.lua` and `gum_env.lua` at login, Neovim loads `neovim.lua` at startup),
the terminal configs `alacritty.toml`, `foot.ini`, `ghostty.conf` and
`kitty.conf` (each names the program the terminal launches), and `vscode.json`
(names a VS Code extension to install). Those are regenerated from `colors.toml`
through `$OMARCHY_PATH/default/themed/*.tpl`, and named on stderr.

Everything else a cloned theme ships is kept, including `btop.theme`,
`chromium.theme`, `helix.toml`, `icons.theme`, `keyboard.rgb` and `shell.toml`.
Omarchy tells a cloned theme from the user's own by the `.git` directory a clone
leaves behind.

To change how Omarchy themes an app for every theme, write the template rather
than the theme: `~/.config/omarchy/themed/<config-name>.tpl` overrides the
built-in one. See `docs/theming.md` in the Omarchy repo.

## Customizing a Stock Theme

Never edit stock themes under `/usr/share/omarchy/themes/` — changes are lost
on update. Two safe options:

Both write into `~/.config/omarchy/themes`, where a theme the user wrote is
unrestricted — the list above applies only to a theme cloned from a repo.

**Overlay (preferred for small tweaks):** create a user theme directory with
the SAME slug containing only the files you want to change. When the theme is
applied, the stock theme is copied first and your files win on top:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/omarchy/themes/catppuccin
cp /usr/share/omarchy/themes/catppuccin/colors.toml ~/.config/omarchy/themes/catppuccin/
# Edit the copied colors.toml, then re-apply:
omarchy theme set catppuccin
```

**Fork:** copy the whole stock theme under a new name for a fully independent
variant:

```bash
cp -r /usr/share/omarchy/themes/catppuccin ~/.config/omarchy/themes/catppuccin-custom
# Edit ~/.config/omarchy/themes/catppuccin-custom/, then:
omarchy theme set catppuccin-custom
```

## Fonts

Fonts are a global user preference, not a per-theme setting. Changing the font
here affects every theme until the user changes it again.

```bash
omarchy font list               # Available fonts
omarchy font current            # Current font
omarchy font set <name>         # Change font globally
```
